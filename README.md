A iOS application written in Swift, this project is a library for CocoaPods that allows you to validate, generate and manipulate CPF and CNPJ numbers in a simple and efficient way. Ideal for testing and filling out forms.

## Difference between CPF and CNPJ

- CPF (Individual Taxpayer Registry): The CPF is an individual registration number used by the Brazilian Federal Revenue Service to identify an individual. The CPF is made up of 11 digits (XXX.XXX.XXX-XX). It is used for various purposes, such as opening bank accounts, issuing invoices, and filing taxes.

- CNPJ (National Registry of Legal Entities): The CNPJ is a registration number used by the Brazilian Federal Revenue Service to identify companies or other legal entities. The CNPJ is made up of 14 digits (XX.XXX.XXX/0001-XX). It is used to formalize the existence of a company, allowing it to carry out commercial activities, such as issuing invoices, paying taxes, among others.

## Requirements

- iOS 17.0 or later
- Xcode 15.0 or later
- Swift 5.0 or later

## Functionalities

- [x] CPF Validation: Check if a CPF number is valid, following the rules of the Federal Revenue Service.
- [x] CNPJ Validation: Check if a CNPJ number is valid, according to tax rules. 
- [x] Fictitious CPF generation: Generate a valid CPF number randomly.
- [x] Fictitious CNPJ generation: Generate a valid CNPJ number randomly.

## Instalation with Cocoapods

Add the dependency to your Podfile:

```sh
$ pod 'CPFCNPJTools'
```

Then run:

```sh
$ pod install
```

## Instalation with (SPM) - Swift Package Manager (Xcode 11+)

[Swift Package Manager (SPM)](https://www.swift.org/documentation/package-manager) is a tool for managing the distribution of Swift code as well as C-family dependency. From Xcode 11, SwiftPM got natively integrated with Xcode.

CPFCNPJTools support SPM from version 5.1.0. To use SPM, you should use Xcode to open your project. Click `File` -> `Add Package Dependencies`, enter [CPFCNPJTools repo's URL](https://github.com/diggosilva/CPFCNPJTools). 

## HowToUse

### 1.1 Validate CPF

- To validate a CPF, simply use the `validate(cpf:)` method:

```swift
let validator = CPFValidator()
let result = validator.validate(cpf: "11144477735")
print(result) // .valid or .invalid
 ```

### 1.2 Generate Fake CPF

 - To generate a fake CPF, simply use the `generateFakeCPF()` method:

 ```swift
 let validator = CPFValidator()
 let fakeCPF = validator.generateFakeCPF()
 print(fakeCPF) // "11144477735"
```

### 1.3 Generate Fake CPF masked

- To generate a fake CPF with mask, simply use the `generateFakeCPFMasked()` method:

```swift
let validator = CPFValidator()
let fakeCPFMasked = validator.generateFakeCPFMasked()
print(fakeCPFMasked) // "111.444.777-35"
```
### 2.1 Validate CNPJ

- To validate a CNPJ, simply use the `validate(cnpj:)` method:

```swift
let validator = CNPJValidator()
let result = validator.validate(cnpj: "11444777000135")
print(result) // .valid or .invalid
```

### 2.2 Generate Fake CNPJ

```swift
let validator = CNPJValidator()
let fakeCNPJ = validator.generateFakeCNPJ()
print(fakeCNPJ) // "11444777000135"
```

### 2.3 Generate Fake CNPJ masked

```swift
let validator = CNPJValidator()
let fakeCNPJMasked = validator.generateFakeCNPJMasked()
print(fakeCNPJMasked) // "11.444.777/0001-35"
```

## Notes:
